# 💧 Automatic_Irrigation_System

## I. Introduction

This system supports multiple control modes:
- 🧑‍🌾 Local manual control using a keypad interface
- ⏰ Scheduled automatic watering
- 📱 Remote control via a mobile application

This repository contains the implementation of an Automatic Irrigation System, developed in 2022 as part of my participation in a national startup competition.

The system is designed to optimize water usage and provide flexible operation. It supports two main control methods:
- **🧑‍🌾 Local control**: Users can operate the system directly using a built-in keypad, including the ability to set a timer for scheduled irrigation.
- **📱 Remote control**: The system can also be operated through a mobile application with similar functionality.
  
By combining automation, scheduling, and remote access, this project offers a practical solution for home gardens and small-scale farms.

Before the competition, our product was tested on the EIU campus, demonstrated its effectiveness, and was selected among the top 70 teams in the national finals.

Then we also implemented a small prototype version to demonstrate the features at the national finals round.
